# tasks file for ansible_collections/netapp/ontap/roles/na_ontap_vserver_delete
# This deletes a vserver and dependents:
#   all volumes are deleted, including any user data !!!
#   network interfaces are deleted
# At present, clones or snapshots are not deleted, this may block the volume and vserver deletion.
#
# These tasks expect the following variables to be set:
# hostname: IP address of ONTAP admin interface (can be vsadmin too).
# username: user account with admin or vsadmin role.
# password: for the user account with admin or vsadmin role.
# vserver_name: name of vserver to delete.
#
# The following variables are preset but can be changed
# https: true
# validate_certs: true   (true is strongly recommended, but use false if the certificate is not set)
# debug_level: 0
# check_mode: false
# confirm_before_removing_interfaces: true
# confirm_before_removing_volumes: true
